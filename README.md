# ANTs Ecosystem Overview

Brief introductory material showcasing R and Python wrapping of ANTs functionality

# 9:15 - 10: Special Intro to ANTS (for ICERM grads and postdocs)

* background (discussed in parallel with installation)

    * ITK and ANTs
 
    * ANTs history and current development strategy

    * Information resources (GitHub, Sourceforge)

* installation

    * ANTsR

    * ANTsPy

# 10:30 - 12: Intro to ANTs for Medical Imaging

* Discussion:  ITK definition of images (physical space, transformation, etc.)

* Discussion and working examples:  

    * image registration

    * image segmentation

    * template construction

    * joint label fusion for anatomical labeling

    * functional MRI quantification

# 12 - 1:30: Lunch

# 1:30 - 3: Deep Learning and Statistical Approaches in Medical Imaging

* Discussion:  Overview of ANTsRNet

    * Tensorflow + Keras

    * pre-trained networks

* Discussion and working examples:  

    * U-net segmentation with template-based augmentation

        * brain extraction
 
       * brain segmentation (whole image, patch-based)

       * tumor segmentation

    * Deep learning-based regression

        * super-resolution

       * Res-nets and other architectures

* Other possible topics (time permitting)

    * clustering

    * activation maps

    * deep feature maps

# 3:30 - 4:30: "Ask us about…” audience-motivated discussion of other topics

* Possible topics:

    * neuroimaging modalities:  DTI, PET, ASL, BOLD fMRI, microscopy

    * non-human primate and other animal studies

    * other organs:  lungs, heart

    * population variability:  baby brains, neurodegeneration, stroke/lesions, etc.

    * integration of imaging, genetics, psychometrics, etc.

    * role of these tools in industry as applications, scientific tools in treatment of disease, etc.
