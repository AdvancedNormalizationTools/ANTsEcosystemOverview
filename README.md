# ANTs Ecosystem Overview

Brief introductory material showcasing R and Python wrapping of ANTs functionality


## 1. Setup

### compile from source

    * ANTs
    * ANTsR
    * ANTsPy
    
### install from release

    * ANTsR
    * ANTsPy
    
### testing

    * C++
    * ANTsR
    * ANTsPy
    
## 2. Image quantification with ANTs

Examples in both `R` and `python`.

### 2.1 Image physical space


### 2.2 Image Transformation

### 2.3 Image Registration

### 2.4 Image Segmentation

### 2.5 Building a template

### 2.6 Anatomical labeling

### 2.7 Functional MRI Quantification


## 3. Deep learning with ANTs

Build on previous examples to demonstrate how image registration, templates and segmentation relate to concepts in deep learning.

### 3.1 Segmentation with UNets

### 3.2 Template-based augmentation

### 3.3 Deep learning based regression

#### 3.3.1 Super-resolution

#### 3.3.2 ResNets and related

## 4. Statisitical inference and interpretable deep learning with ANTs

Connect deep learning to regression, clustering and other statistical concepts.

Show a learning based example in comparison to a voxe-wise regression.

Demonstrate activation maps, individual-level interpretation of activations, learning, pre-trained networks, fine-tuning, deep feature maps.  


## 5. Ask us about

* neuroimaging modalities:  DTI, PET, ASL, BOLD fMRI, microscopy

* non-human primate and other animal studies

* population variability:  baby brains, atrophy/neurodegeneration, stroke/lesions, etc.

* integration of imaging and genetics, psychometrics, etc.
